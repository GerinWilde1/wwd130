    <p>Hello, I'm Gerin Wilde. I'm from Texas but the last place I lived before Rexburg was Copan Ruinas, Honduras and New Orleans.</p>
        <p>I'm getting my Computer Science degree, I'd like to do something actually science related with it. I'm not married anymore and I have no children.
        I'm in school fulltime at the moment, but I'm looking for a job.</p>
        <p>While I do appriceate BYU-I and the opportunity it gives us all, I don't really enjoy Rexburg... it's cold.
        While I am studying CS I do see the value in learning website design. If not just because there are so many jobs out there for it.
        I'm in the course now because it turns out I never took it earlier. I thought I had, but after talking to a councelor,
        it turns out that it was just hidden from me for some reason.
        <p>I've been a member all my life and my favorite scripture is D&C 131:19-21
